        <h1>Biryani Recipe</h1>
        <p>This spicy biryani has got to be one of the most flavourful biryani versions and is extremely popular all
            over the world.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 kg mutton/goat, cut into big pieces (or one chicken cut into 8 pieces)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup yoghurt</li>
            <li>1 tsp ginger paste</li>
            <li>1 tsp garlic paste</li>
            <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp red chilli powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp turmeric powder</li>
            <li>1 green chilli, chopped</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>5 cups long grain basmati rice</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinate the meat in the remaining marinade ingredients for at least 2 hours or preferably refrigerate
                overnight. </li>
            <li>This helps tenderise the meat and builds flavour. Remember to remove the meat half an hour before you
                begin cooking to bring it to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Deep fry the potato chunks on low heat until a knife pierced through the centre of each potato piece
                yields easily</li>
            <li>Drain and set aside (you may opt to boil the potatoes if you like, but I find they hold their shape and
                taste a lot better fried).</li>
            <li>Wash and then soak the rice for about 20-30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat the half cup of oil in a deep pan and then fry the onion slices until golden.</li>
            <li>Remove a quarter of the fried onions (these will be used later) and leave the rest in the pan</li>
            <li> Add the whole spices (cumin, cadamom, pepper, cloves, bay leaves, cinnamon and black pepper). </li>
            <li>Once they sizzle, add the garlic and ginger pastes and stir them in until aromatic</li>
            <li>Next, add tomatoes, prunes, turmeric, salt and red chilli powder.</li>
        </ol>
