    <h3>Host selection</h3>
    <p>The bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups began in January 2009. National associations had
        until 2<sup>nd</sup> February 2009 to register interest.[41] Initially, 11 bids were made for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but
        Mexico withdrew from proceedings,[42][43] and Indonesia's bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the
        Indonesian Football Association failed to submit a letter of Indonesian government guarantee to support the
        bid. Qatar were the only team making their debut in the <i>FIFA World Cup</i></p><br>
