        <h2 id="abstraction">Abstraction</h2>
        <p>Data abstraction is the most essential function of object-oriented programming in C++. Abstraction means
            displaying only basic information and hiding the details.<br>Data abstraction refers to providing only
            necessary information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background info or implementation.

        <p> <strong>Abstraction Using Classes</strong></p>
        <p> We can implement Abstraction in C++ using classes. The class helps us group data members and member
            functions using available access specifiers. A class can decide which data member will be visible to the
            outside world and not.</p>

        <p><strong>Abstraction Using Header Files</strong></p>
        <p>One more type of abstraction in C++ can be header files. For example, consider the pow() technique present in
            the math.h header file. Whenever we need to calculate the power of a number, we call the function pow()
            present in the math.h header file and pass the numbers as arguments without knowing the underlying algorithm
            according to which the function calculates the power of numbers.</p>

        <h2 id="encapsulation">Encapsulation</h2>
        <p>In common terms, Encapsulation is defined as wrapping up of data and information under a single unit. In
            object-oriented programming,<br> Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions
            that
            manipulate them.

            Encapsulation also leads to data abstraction or hiding.<br> Using Encapsulation also hides the data. In the
            previous example, the data of any of the sections like sales, finance, or accounts are hidden from any other
            area.
        
        <strong>Example</strong><br>
        <p>
            #include<iostream><br>
                using namespace std;<br>
                class Encapsulation <br>

                {<br>
                    private: <br>
                        int a;     
                    public: <br>
                        void set(int x) <br>
                        {<br>
                            a =x; <br>
                        } <br>
                        int get() <br>
                        { <br>
                            return a; <br>
                        } <br>
                }; <br>
               <p>
                int main() <br>
                { <br>
                    Encapsulation obj;<br>
                    obj.set(10); <br> 
                  <p>cout<<obj.get() </p> <br>
                    return 0;  > <br>
                } <br>
              
        </p>  
        </p>
    </p>

    <div>
        <h2 id="inheritance"> Inheritance</h2>
        <p>Inheritance is the process in which two classes have a relationship with each other, and objects of one class
            acquire properties and features of the other class. The class which inherits the features is known as the
            child class, and the class whose features it inherited is called the parent class.</p>

    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 id="polymorphism"> Polymorphism</h2>
        <p>The word polymorphism means having many forms. It is the ability to take more than one form. It is a feature
            that provides a function or an operator with more than one definition. It can be implemented using function
            overloading, operator overload, function overriding, virtual function. An operation may show off different
            behaviors at different times.</p>
